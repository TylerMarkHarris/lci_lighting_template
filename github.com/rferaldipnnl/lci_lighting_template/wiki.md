# LCI Lighting Template Wiki
Welcome to the content repository **WIKI** for the [Life cycle inventory (LCI) lighting data collection template](https://www.energy.gov/eere/ssl/life-cycle-inventory-template-luminaires), a data collection template for the linked openLCA model Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for automated Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) results generation. The most important resources are shown in the table below.

The [Life cycle inventory (LCI) lighting data collection template](https://www.energy.gov/eere/ssl/life-cycle-inventory-template-luminaires) is a tool designed to reduce the barriers for the lighting industry to participate in data-driven sustainability. It also aims to increase the adoption and comparability of Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) and Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) across industries to support reduction of embodied carbon, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental impacts. Currently, the LCA process can be expensive and confusing, and LCA information for certain components (such as drivers and small electronics) can be difficult to obtain, which complicates the development of luminaire-level LCAs.

The LCI Template for Luminaires supports rapid decarbonization of U.S. building stock, as well as DOE’s vision for a net-zero U.S. building sector by 2050, by streamlining, simplifying, and standardizing the data collection and sustainability reporting process. This template aims to reduce the overall time and resources needed to complete an LCI and is tailored specifically for the lighting industry – addressing some of the component and materials gaps that are specific to lighting products – with a North American geographic scope.

BETA Version of the Life Cycle Inventory Template for Luminaires is now available.
